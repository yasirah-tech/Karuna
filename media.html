                    <p class="lead"> #MaybeHeDoesntHitYou was a movement that trended on twitter a week ago where people would share their stories on how domestic abuse can come in forms other than 
                    physical. Women from all across the internet would share stories not about physical but mental and psychological abuse that they had to endure in their relationships.
                    That was the premise of the movement. Originally this movement was created in 2016 but recently has come back to the surface of the internet to educate more people on the problem.
                    You can learn more on the original movement and its starting point <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/hashtag-maybe-he-doesnt-hit-you-relationship-violence" target="_blank"> here.</a></p>
