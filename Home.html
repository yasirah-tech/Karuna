     <p id="info" > Domestic violence in the United States is a form of violence that occurs within a domestic relationship. It may also describe other household violence, such as violence against a child, by a child against a parent or violence between siblings in the same household. It is recognized as an important social problem by governmental and non-governmental agencies, and various Violence Against Women Acts have been passed by the US Congress in an attempt to stem this tide.
     The goal of this website is to educate you in the tragedys of Domestic Violence and why you should spread awareness.</p>
